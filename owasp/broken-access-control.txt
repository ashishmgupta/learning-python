# Access can be seen as two types
    # Horizontal Access
        # Users with same permission level can not access each others data ("Same permission level" - thats why "horizontal")
    # Vertical Access
        # Users with different permission level can not perform actions they are not authorized to.
        # Think in terms of Subject, Object and Action
        # Subject (who is attempting to access e.g. user) - Object (What is being accessed e.g. File) - Action (What is action e.g. Delete)
        # Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is a nice way to implement Vertical access
