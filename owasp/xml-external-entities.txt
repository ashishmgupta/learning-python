XML can reference external files (entities )

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo[<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">]>
<body>Meeting &xxe;</body>

xxe is reffered in the body of teh xml
If the xml is interpreted as is, It will also print the contents of win.ini


# Defense 
#  Dont use XML if possible
#  Make sure teh website runs with account with limited permissions
