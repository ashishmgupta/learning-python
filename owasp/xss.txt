        Specifies the location where the scripts (or css, images etc) can be loaded from the page
        Can be sent as response header

        e.g. Consider the below header
        Content-Security-Policy: script=src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
        'script-src' means Its about loading of scripts
        'self' means load the scripts, images, css from the same domain. 
        'unsafe-inline' means page can have inline javascript
